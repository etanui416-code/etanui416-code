## About Me & Focus Areas
I am an open-source Bitcoin and Lightning Network contributor-in-training.  
Currently focused on:
- Bitcoin Core protocol internals and security
- Lightning Network HTLCs, channel lifecycle, and routing
- Layer-2 scalability and risk analysis
- Integration and best practices for BDK-based wallets

I document my learning publicly, share research notes, and aim to contribute to meaningful PRs in Bitcoin and Lightning projects.

## Key Study Repositories
Here are my main repositories for study and development:

- [bitcoin-core-notes](https://github.com/etanui416-code/bitcoin-core-notes) — Personal study notes on Bitcoin Core internals, transaction validation, mempool policies, and consensus rules.

## Current Goals
- Transitioning from note-taking and PR reviews to actual contributions on Bitcoin Core and Lightning Dev projects.
- Building reproducible examples for BDK integration.
- Improving Lightning channel security documentation and threat analysis.
- Maintaining a public repository of research for educational purposes.
